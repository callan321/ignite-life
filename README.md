## Known Issues

### Chrome DevTools Issue â€“ Temporary Patch in `/public`

**Error:**

```txt
No route matches URL "/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json"
```

Chrome DevTools triggers this request automatically. React Router does not
handle this path by default.

**Temporary Fix:**  
An empty static file has been placed in the `public/.well-known/appspecific/`
folder as a workaround to suppress the error in the console.

You can **safely delete** this file once the issue is resolved in Chrome or
React Router.
